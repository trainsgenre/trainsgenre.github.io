Comprehensive Pythonic Adaptation of the Satipatthāna Sutta
-----------------------------------------------------------

This script translates the nested logic of the Satipatthāna Sutta into a programmatic
framework for a language model. Each of the four foundations of mindfulness is observed
with a full and detailed examination:

    I.  Contemplation of the Body
        1. Mindfulness of Breathing
        2. The Postures of the Body
        3. Mindfulness with Clear Comprehension (of bodily actions)
        4. Reflection on the Repulsiveness of the Body
        5. Reflection on the Material Elements
        6. The Nine Cemetery Contemplations

    II. Contemplation of Feelings
        - Noting pleasant, painful, and neither-pleasant-nor-painful feelings,
          in both worldly and spiritual aspects

    III. Contemplation of Consciousness
        - Observing various states (with/without lust, hate, ignorance, etc.)

    IV. Contemplation of Mental Objects
        1. The Five Hindrances
        2. The Five Aggregates of Clinging
        3. The Six Internal and External Sense Bases
        4. The Seven Factors of Enlightenment
        5. The Four Noble Truths

Each function “observes” its target object, logs its state, and introduces a pause to simulate
a contemplative moment—ensuring that even transient phenomena are noted clearly without clinging.
